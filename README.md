# Description

A robust system monitoring tool designed to analyze `.log` files, filter critical events, and generate comprehensive reports. It utilizes low-level C programming for performance and bash scripting for automation.

---

# Key Features
- **Log Collection & Filtering:** Regex-based filtering for system, network, and security logs.
- **Automated Analysis:** A bash script (`run_monitor.sh`) automates the entire monitoring workflow.
- **High Performance:** Core analysis logic is written in C for efficiency.
- **Parallel Processing:** Utilizes POSIX Threads ([`pthread`](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?pthread)) to analyze multiple `.log` files simultaneously, significantly reducing processing time on large datasets.

---

# Prerequisites

To build and run this project, a UNIX-based environment is required. The key prerequisites are:

- [GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)](https://gcc.gnu.org/): Required for compiling the C code. It includes the necessary system libraries ([Standard C Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/)) and support for POSIX Threads ([`pthread`](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?pthread)), which is essential for the parallelization part of the project.

- [Bash Shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/): Necessary for executing the automation scripts (`run_monitor.sh`).

- [GNU Coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/): Standard command-line utilities (such as [`grep`](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?grep), [`awk`](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?awk), [`find`](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?find)) used for log management and filtering.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): Used for version control.

## Windows
[WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL) is required because Windows isn't a UNIX-based operating system. Please refer to the [WSL installation guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

> **After installing WSL:** Open your Linux terminal and proceed to the **[Linux](#linux)** section below.

## macOS
If you want just the essential packages, continue with the `xcode-select` installation:
```bash
# Minimal prerequisites installation
xcode-select --install
```
Or if you have the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager installed, continue with the [`gcc`](https://gcc.gnu.org/) and [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) installation:
```bash
# Update Homebrew
brew update

# Install GCC and Git
brew install gcc git
```
*Note: macOS uses [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) aliased as [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) by default*

## Linux

To identify which Linux distribution you are using, you can run in your terminal:
```bash
# Distribution identification
cat /etc/os-release

# Build

1. Go to the directory where you want the project to be:
```bash
cd path/to/your/directory/
```

2. Clone the project with [`git`](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?git):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xiromeritis/UNIX-based-Event-Monitoring-Infrastructure.git
```

3. Go to the project's directory:
```bash
cd UNIX-based-Event-Monitoring-Infrastructure/
```

4. Compile the C programs: You need to compile both the single-file analyzer and the multithreaded version.
```bash
# Compile the main analyzer
gcc analyze.c -o analyze_log

# Compile the parallel analyzer (requires pthread library)
gcc -pthread parallel_analyze.c -o parallel_analyze_logs
```

5. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x run_monitor.sh
```

# Usage

## Option 1: Automated Monitoring
Run the automation script by providing the directory containing your logs:
```bash
bash ./run_monitor.sh monitor/raw/
```
This command will analyze all logs in the specified directory and generate a summary report in `monitor/reports/full_report.txt`.

### Example Output
When running the automation script, you

### Example Output
When running the automation script, you will see output similar to this:
```text
SCRIPT: ./run_monitor.sh running with 1 argument

Starting continuous monitoring...
(Exit with: ^C)


[Day Mon  D HH:MM:SS EET YYYY] - Running analysis cycle...

Analyzing: [NETWORK TRAFFIC]: network.log...
   -> Analyzed successfully.
Analyzing: [SECURITY ALERT]: security.log...
   -> Analyzed successfully.
Analyzing: [SYSTEM EVENT]: system.log...
   -> Analyzed successfully.

Report updated. Waiting 60 seconds...
```
This will spawn a separate thread for each `.log` file provided and output the statistics directly to the console.

## Option 2: Parallel Analysis
To demonstrate the multi-threading capabilities, you can run the parallel analyzer directly:
```bash
./parallel_analyze_logs monitor/raw/*.log
```
This will spawn a separate thread for each log file provided and output the statistics directly to the console.
### Example Output
When running the parallel analyzer, you will see output similar to this:
```text
Starting parallel analysis on 3 files...

File: monitor/raw/network.log        | Lines:   5 | Errors:   1
File: monitor/raw/security.log       | Lines:   5 | Errors:   0
File: monitor/raw/system.log         | Lines:   5 | Errors:   0
                        TOTAL LINES:  15
                        TOTAL ERRORS: 1
```
